A small amount of variability is imposed by the parameter ***Synch. $\\sigma$ [ms]***, so the reference spike time is the mean value while ***Synch. $\\sigma$ [ms]*** is the standard deviation of a gaussian distribution."

    "To analyse the EMG signal in time domain, which can be non-stationary,  we used in this work a simple moving RMS technique. It is a type of finite impulse response filter and is used to smooth the short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trend. For other time domain methods: [Challis and Kitney, 1990](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02442601 \"Biomedical signal processing (in four parts) - Part 1 Time-domain methods\"). Furthermore, to analyse the EMG signal in frequency domain, we used two methods: Welch's periodogram ([Challis and Kitney, 1991](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02446704 \"Biomedical signal processing (in four parts) - Part Part 3 The power spectrum and coherence function\")) and Spectrogram. Welch's method is an approach for spectral density estimation, which has the property to reduces noise in exchange of frequency resolution. This method is applied on the entire analysis interval and adequate for stationary signals. The Spectrogram method, which uses Short-time Fourier transform to be generated, is used to determine sinusoidal frequency of the EMG signal as it changes over time and is suitable for non-stationary signals.  \n",

This relationship between stimulus rate and MU isometric force has a sigmoidal shape, saturating at a given stimulus rate. Usually, the stimulus rate for MU force saturation is bigger then 50 imp/s for muscles that control digits of the hand ([Fuglevand et al, 1999](https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.1999.81.4.1718 \"Force-Frequency and Fatigue Properties of Motor Units in Muscles That Control Digits of the Human Hand\")).\n",
