    "This notebook  section generates the relatioship between the common drive input (composed of peripheral, spinal and descending excitatory inputs) to the motor neuron pool and each motor neuron firing rate of the pool. Each motor unit (MU) is composed by one motor neuron and it's innervated muscle fibers. This phenomelogical approach to motor unit pools is based on the work of [Fuglevand et al.

To simulate it, we define two different distributions, one for the motor units that innervate type I muscle fibres and for type II muscle fibres. Each motor unit position is defined by polar coordanates, i.d., the distance from the origin is called radius and the angle formed with the vertical is called polar angle. All motor units will have their polar angle defined by a stochastic process with uniform distribution  with limits depending on the choosen morphology. The radius coordinate is also defined by an stochastic process, but with a gaussian distribution.Here we have control over this radius coordinate distribution with the variable ___Type I $\\mu$___, which defines the distribution center for Type I motor units and is normalized by the muscle external radius. ___Type II $\\mu$___ is the same of  ___Type I $\\mu$___, but defining the distribution center for Type II (a and b) motor units. On the other hand, ___Type I $\\sigma$___ defines the standard deviation of the gaussian distribution of the radius for Type I motor units, also normalized by muscle external radius. ___Type II $\\sigma$___ is the same of ___Type I $\\sigma$___, but for the Type II (a and b) motor units.\n",

    "## Surface EMG analysis\n",
    "To analyse the EMG signal in time domain, which can be non-stationary,  we used in this work a simple moving average technique. It is a type of finite impulse response filter and is used to smooth the short-term fluctuations and highlight longer-term trend. For other time domain methods: [Challis and Kitney, 1990](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02442601 \"Biomedical signal processing (in four parts) - Part 1 Time-domain methods\"). Furthermore, to analyse the EMG signal in frequency domain, we used two methods: Welch's periodogram ([Challis and Kitney, 1991](https://doi.org/10.1007/BF02446704 \"Biomedical signal processing (in four parts) - Part Part 3 The power spectrum and coherence function\")) and Spectrogram. Welch's method is an approach for spectral density estimation, which has the property to reduces noise in exchange of frequency resolution. This method is applied on the entire analysis interval and adequate for stationary signals. The Spectrogram method, which uses Short-time Fourier transform to be generated, is used to determine sinusoidal frequency of the EMG signal as it changes over time and is suitable for non-stationary signals.  \n",
