# NEUROMUSCULAR MODEL NOTEBOOK
The neuromuscular model notebook is an interactive tool for studying the underlying mechanisms of electromyogram (EMG) and force generation. The model, which was based on previous studies (see references below), can be used for research purposes as well as a teaching platform.

The notebook was created by [Ricardo G. Molinari](https://github.com/molinaris) under the supervision of [Dr. Leonardo A. Elias](https://github.com/leoelias-unicamp) at the [Neural Engineering Research Laboratory](http://www.fee.unicamp.br/deb/leoelias/ner-lab?language=en), [University of Campinas](http://www.unicamp.br/unicamp/english) (Brazil).

## Installation Instructions
### Dependencies
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) (a Python Data Science Plataform)
  - If you already have an Anaconda distribution installed in your computer, it is important to update it:

    `conda update conda`

### Creating the Environment
After installing Anaconda, you have to create a Python 3.7 environment with the following packages: NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy, Pandas, Ipywidgets, and Plotly. Use the following command in Anaconda terminal:

`conda create -n nb_env python=3.7.0 numpy=1.17.0 matplotlib=3.1.1 scipy=1.1.0 pandas=0.23.4 ipywidgets=7.4.1`

### Activating the environment
- Windows users: `activate nnm_env`
- Linux/MacOS users: `source activate nnm_env`

### Running the neuromuscular model notebook
- Use the command `jupyter notebook` to start the Jupyter notebook application.
- In Jupyter notebook, open the file 'NeuromuscularModel.ipynb'.
- It is highly recommended to execute each cell in the order of appearance, since there are dependences between the cells.
